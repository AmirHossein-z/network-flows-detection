# network-flows-detection

This project detects network flows from a pcap file.
It includes some filter features base on [this articles](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12083-012-0150-x)

**Note:** This project was forked from [this repo](https://github.com/drnpkr/flowRecorder) and customized base on my requirements. Also that repo lacks TCP handling packets, so I try to implement this in this repo.

# Usage

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  cd src
  python3 main.py
```
